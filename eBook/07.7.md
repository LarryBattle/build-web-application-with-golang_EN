# 7.7 Summary

In this chapter, we introduced how to handle XML, JSON, Regexp and template.
XML and JSON are data exchange formats, which can be use to represent various kinds of information. 
Regexp is a pattern used for searching, replacing, matching characters within strings. 
With a template, you can easily create a dynamic page by combining data with static files. 
These tools are all useful when developing web application. 
I hope you understand more about processing and displaying content.
